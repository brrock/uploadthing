## Usage-based Pricing Now Available for All Users

Starting today, all UploadThing users can opt-in to our new usage-based pricing 
model. This flexible option allows your app to upload unlimited files with 
simple, transparent pricing:

- $25/month base price
- 250GB storage included
- $0.08 per GB for additional storage

As always, we only charge for the storage itself, so you don't have to think
about requests, bandwidth, or anything else.

Ready to upgrade? Visit your [settings](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard?s=billing) 
to switch to usage-based pricing.

## Bring Your Own Bucket (BYOB) - Now in Public Beta

Alongside the launch of usage-based pricing, we're also excited to release a 
public beta of our highly-requested BYOB feature, giving you full control over 
your file storage while maintaining UploadThing's superior developer experience. 
With BYOB, you can:

- Store files directly in your own storage infrastructure
- Meet strict compliance requirements
- Maintain complete control over your data

For the initial public beta, we are launching with support for AWS S3 buckets, 
with more storage providers coming soon based on user demand.

### Getting Started with BYOB
1. Navigate to your [account settings](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard?s=profile)
2. Enable the BYOB feature flag
3. Select the BYOB tier when creating a new app
