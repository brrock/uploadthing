refactor: reduce bundle size

We've continued our efforts to reduce the bundle size of the client side javascript. In a previous minor release, we reduced the bundle size by 70%, from 120kB to 40kB. This release continues on that work with a further reduction of 35% down to just over 25kB client side
javascript shipped to the browser from the `uploadthing/client` package.
